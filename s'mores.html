	  <h4>How to make them:</h4> <p>Take two graham crackers, and make a sandwich with a marshmallow and chocolate. They can be made in the microwave but are far better with a campfire. The word "s'mores" is just a contraction of "some" and "more" because they are so delicious and you'll be wanting more and more forever!</p> <br>

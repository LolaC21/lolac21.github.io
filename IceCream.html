	  <h3>Ice Cream is Amazing</h3>
	   
	  <p> I love eating ice cream on warmer days because it is so refreshing, but there is no wrong time to eat it. It is also super fun to make! I made cookie dough ice cream recently and I want to make strawberry next. I can't pick a favorite ice cream flavor but some great ones I've enjoyed recently are:  </p>

	  <ul>
	  		<li>Cookies & Cream</li>
	  		<li>Banana Pudding</li>
	  		<li>Mint Chip</li>
	  		<li>Lavender Brown Sugar</li>

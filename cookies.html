	  <p> Chocolate chip! Oatmeal! Gingerbread! Shortbread! All cookie types are incredible, so much that I even named my cat Cookie. Out of all the varieties, I would choose Sugar Cookies as the best. Not only do they give you the perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, you can also make decorations with coloful icing. As a tradition, my family always makes sugar cookies cut out in fun shapes and iced according to the holiday: Halloween, Christmas, Easter, and more! </p>
